1. Read files shapes.txt
	file contains multiple lines
	every line contains letter C,R,T (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle) 
	followed by every edge coordinate pairs (x , y)
	(circle has 0 edges followed by center point and any point of circle)
2. Create interface Shape with methods calculatePerimeter, calculateArea and print
3. Create class for Circle, Rectangle, Triangle (every class should implement shape)
4. Output everything to file (shape name, every side length, perimeter, area) as it is in github

this task is not only about interfaces but also about general problem solving skills. Use google, ask questions.
Change in existing classes are not needed except ShapeFactory
