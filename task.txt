there is a lot of duplicate code. What it does is reads dates from files and does something with it, for example
writes hours between those dates.

Your task is:

0. Refactor the code while doing this task.
1. Create an abstract class that will have the duplicate code. It has to have an abstract method which will have the
    code that's unique to the implementation.
2. Create two implementations for the abstract class.
