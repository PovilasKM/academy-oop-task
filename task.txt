	(circle has 0 edges followed by center point and any point of circle)
2. Create interface Shape with methods calculatePerimeter and calculateArea
3. Create class for Circle, Rectangle, Square, Parallelogram (every class should implement shape)
4. Output everything to file (shape name, every side length, perimeter, area)
